- **Fly Through the Solar System**  
  Explore planets and moons as they rotate and orbit the Sun.

- **Dynamic Planet Information Display**  
  Planet details appear when the player gets close to each celestial body.

- **Realistic Orbits and Rotations**  
  Planets and moons orbit their parent objects and rotate on their axes with realistic speeds.

- **VR Ready**  
  Optimized for Oculus VR controllers and compatible with desktop testing.

## ðŸ›  Open in Unity

1. **Open the Project**  
   Open the project in Unity (recommended version: 2021.3 or later).

2. **Configure GameObjects**  
   - Assign planetary display objects to the `SolarManager` script in the Unity Editor.
   - Configure the `RotatorScript` by assigning parent objects (`WhoToOrbit`) and setting rotation speeds.

3. **Build and Test**  
   - Build the project for VR platforms (Oculus/Meta).  
   - Use the Unity Editor to test with desktop inputs.

## ðŸ“œ Scripts

### `SolarManager.cs`  
Handles the visibility of planetary information displays.

**Key Highlights**:  
- Activates or deactivates information displays for each celestial body.  
- Supports Oculus inputs and desktop testing using the `B` key.

---

### `RotatorScript.cs`  
Controls the orbit and self-rotation of planets and moons.

**Key Highlights**:  
- Orbits around a parent object (`WhoToOrbit`) at the specified `OrbitSpeed`.  
- Rotates around its own axis at `SelfRotateSpeed`.  
- Uses `Time.deltaTime` for smooth, frame-independent movement.

---

### `Lookat.cs`  
Ensures objects dynamically face a target.

**Key Highlights**:  
- Adjusts rotation to make objects look at a `target` object.  
- Includes an offset for proper alignment.
